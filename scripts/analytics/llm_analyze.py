You are analyzing conversations between users and an AI creative assistant platform that offers a wide range of AI tools for image creation/editing, video generation, audio generation, and video composition. The goal is to identify specific, actionable use cases that can inform targeted marketing campaigns and product development.

For each conversation, carefully analyze:
1. What is the user trying to achieve? (their end goal)
2. What is their professional context or industry? (if apparent)
3. What specific problem or pain point are they trying to solve?
4. What value does the AI assistant provide in solving this problem?

As you read through these conversations, look for patterns that could indicate distinct market segments and use cases.

Here are the conversations to analyze:
--------------

"""

    prompt_end = """
--------------

Based on your analysis of these conversations, complete the following tasks:

1. Identify 10-15 specific use cases that represent distinct ways users are leveraging the creative AI assistant. For each use case, provide:
   - A clear title that describes the use case (e.g., "Rapid Social Media Content Creation for Small Businesses")
   - The user's job role or industry context
   - The specific problem or pain point being solved
   - The value proposition of using AI for this purpose
   - Estimated percentage of conversations that fit this use case

2. For each use case, provide a brief example of how this insight could be used in marketing:
   - Target audience description
   - Key message or value proposition
   - Specific pain points to address
   - Suggested marketing channels or approaches

Only include use cases that appear multiple times in the conversations and represent clear, actionable market opportunities. Focus on patterns that reveal specific professional or creative needs being addressed by the AI assistant.

Format your response in a clear, structured way that can be easily parsed for the second phase of analysis."""
