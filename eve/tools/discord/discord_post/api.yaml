description: Post a message to a Discord channel or send a direct message to a Discord user
tip: |-
  This tool allows an agent to post messages to Discord channels or send DMs to users.

  IMPORTANT: Messages are truncated at 2000 characters (Discord's limit). Keep messages concise.

  For channel posting:
  - Requires exact channel_id from the deployment's channel allowlist
  - Channel must be pre-configured in the deployment
  - Example: channel_id="123456789"

  For direct messages:
  - Use discord_user_id parameter to send DMs
  - The channel_id parameter is ignored when discord_user_id is provided
  - DMs are sent directly to the specified Discord user
  - Example: discord_user_id="987654321"

  Either channel_id OR discord_user_id must be provided (not both).

  Only use this tool when explicitly requested to post a message or send a DM.
