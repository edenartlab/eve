tip: |-
  This tool allows an agent to post messages to Discord channels or send DMs to users.

  For channel posting:
  - "Post 'Hello everyone!' to general chat"
  - "Send announcement to the news channel"
  - "Share this update in tech support"

  For direct messages:
  - Use discord_user_id parameter to send DMs
  - The channel_id parameter is ignored when discord_user_id is provided
  - DMs are sent directly to the specified Discord user

  Only use this tool when explicitly requested to post a message or send a DM.
