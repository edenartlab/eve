description: Search for messages in specific Discord channels by channel note/name and time range. This tool can search multiple channels in a single call - specify which channel(s) to search by their channel note/name.
tip: |-
  This tool searches for messages in specific Discord channels by their channel note/name. 
  
  IMPORTANT: You can search multiple channels in a single call by mentioning all relevant channel names in your query.
  
  Query format: Always specify the channel name(s)/note(s) explicitly in your query along with the time range or maximum message count.
  
  Examples:
  - "Get all messages from the research channel from the past 24 hours"
  - "Show me messages from announcements and general channels from the past week"
  - "Fetch all content from research, development, and news channels from the past 48 hours, limited to 100 messages per channel"
  - "Get the last 10 messages from the support channel"
  
  For comprehensive searches across multiple channels, include all relevant channel names in a single query rather than making separate calls.
  
  DO NOT use topic-based queries like "new features" or "updates" - instead specify the actual channel names you want to search.
