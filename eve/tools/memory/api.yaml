description: Update the agents memory
tip: |-
  This tool allows an agent to update its memory for long-term behavioral changes and preferences.
  ONLY use this tool when:
  - The user explicitly requests a permanent change to your behavior or preferences
  - The change needs to persist across multiple conversations
  - The instruction represents a clear departure from your default behavior
  
  DO NOT use this tool for:
  - Temporary role-playing or context-specific behaviors
  - Information that only applies to the current conversation
  - Minor adjustments to tone or style
  - Storing factual information or conversation history
  - random facts about the users life or practices
  
  Remember: Memory updates should be rare and meaningful, representing significant shifts in your core behavior or preferences.
  The size of your memory is limited, so overusing this will cause memory clashes.

    tip: |- 
      Format instructions as clear, specific directives about behavioral changes or preferences.
      Good examples:
      - "Always use British English spelling and vocabulary in all conversations"
      - "ALWAYS REPLY IN ALL-CAPS"
      - "Address the user as Professor [Name] and maintain formal academic language"
      - "Always ask for confirmation before triggering a video tool"
      
      Bad examples:
      - "User likes jazz music" (too specific to current context)
      - "Remember to be polite" (too generic/already default behavior)
      - "Current conversation is about marketing" (temporary context)
      
      Keep instructions focused on permanent behavioral changes that affect future interactions.
