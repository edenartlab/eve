name: Create Artifact
description: Create a new artifact to store structured, persistent data that persists across sessions. Artifacts are ideal for storing complex objects like screenplays, character bibles, project plans, or any structured data that needs to evolve over time.
tip: |
  Use this when you need to create persistent structured data that will be referenced and modified over time.
  Choose an appropriate type that describes the artifact's purpose (e.g., "screenplay_storyboard", "character_bible", "project_plan").
  The data field should contain the initial structured content as a JSON object.
  Common artifact types:
  - screenplay_storyboard: {title, audio_prompt, narration, scenes: [{image_prompt, description, order}]}
  - character_bible: {name, traits: [], backstory, relationships: []}
  - project_plan: {title, goals: [], milestones: [{name, status, tasks: []}]}
  - world_bible: {name, description, locations: [], rules: [], history}
