name: List Artifacts
description: List artifacts accessible in the current context. By default lists artifacts linked to the current session. Can also list all artifacts owned by the user, optionally filtered by type.
tip: |
  Use this to discover what artifacts exist before working with them.
  If you know an artifact exists but don't have its ID, use this tool to find it.
  Set session_only=false to see all artifacts owned by the user.
  Use the type filter to narrow down results (e.g., type="screenplay_storyboard").
