name: Chat
description: |
  Send a message in the multi-agent chatroom. By default, messages are public and visible to all participants.

  For private messaging, set public=false and specify recipients. Private messages are only visible to the
  specified recipients (they will see who else received the message), not to other participants in the chatroom.

  Use cases:
  - Public messages (default): Share your thoughts, results, or responses with everyone
  - Private messages: Coordinate secretly with specific agents (e.g., team discussions in Werewolf)

  IMPORTANT: Include URLs of any media you created (images, videos, audio) in the attachments field.
  Look at the 'url' fields from your tool results and include them so others can see your creations.
