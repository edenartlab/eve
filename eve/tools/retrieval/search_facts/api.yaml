name: search_facts
description: Search long-term memory using query(s). Returns relevant facts from the agent's knowledge base.
tip: |-
  This tool searches the agent's long-term memory for stored facts using hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword search with RRF fusion).

  WHEN TO USE:
  - When you receive a clear question or information request and the answer is not in your current memory context
  - Recalling specific information about users, projects, or events
  - Finding stored contact details, urls, project specifications etc
  - Retrieving factual data that was previously discussed or stored

  CRAFTING EFFECTIVE QUERIES:
  - Be specific: "John's email address" is better than "contact info"
  - Use natural language: "project deadline for Mars Festival" works well
  - Include key entities: usernames, project names, dates, or technical terms
  - For broad searches, use multiple related queries in a list

  QUERY EXAMPLES:
  - Single topic: ["Alice's programming language preferences"]
  - Multiple aspects: ["Mars Festival deadline", "Mars Festival budget", "Mars Festival team members"]

  Using multiple queries is useful when you need to gather information about different aspects of the same topic.
  Each query runs in parallel for efficiency, and results are combined. 
  IMPORTANT:
  - This toolcall takes a few seconds to run, DO NOT execute this unless you really need to search specific information from long-term memory
  - Do not keep calling this tool over and over if no relevant information is returned. This typically means the answer is not stored in memory.
