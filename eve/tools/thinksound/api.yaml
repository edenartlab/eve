name: Add sound to video
description: Generate audio that matches given video content + prompt using ThinkSound.
tip: |-
  This tool synthesizes audio from video content using ThinkSound, enabling video-to-audio generation. The tool can generate various audio effects that match the video content and automatically timed correctly.

parameters:
  video:
    type: video
    description: URL of the base video
    required: true
  caption:
    type: string
    label: Caption
    description: Brief description of the video content
    tip: |-
      A short caption describing what's happening in the video to help the model understand the context.
    required: false
  cot:
    type: string
    label: Chain of thought
    description: Detailed description of the sound generation process
    tip: |-
      A detailed description that begins with the sound process and includes texture, atmosphere, and timing details. This helps the model understand exactly what audio to generate and how it should match the video.
  cfg_scale:
    type: float
    label: CFG Scale
    description: Classifier-free guidance scale
    tip: |-
      Controls how closely the model follows the prompt. Higher values mean stricter adherence to the prompt.
    default: 5
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 20
  num_inference_steps:
    type: integer
    label: Inference steps
    description: Number of inference steps
    tip: |-
      More steps generally produce higher quality but take longer to generate.
    default: 24
    minimum: 10
    maximum: 50
