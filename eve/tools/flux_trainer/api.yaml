name: Agent model trainer (FLUX LoRA)
description: Train a visual model with your images
tip: |-
  This will create a LoRA model from a base Flux-dev which captures and integrates the style, human face, or object represented in the training data.

  name:
    type: string
    label: Model name
    description: Name of your trained model. Does not have to be unique. Used to 'trigger' your model in prompts.
    required: true
  lora_training_urls:
    type: array
    items:
      type: image
    label: Your training images
    description: Images to train your visual model. (Use at least 5 imgs, 10-20 is even better.)
    required: true
    min_length: 1
  mode:
    type: string
    label: Training Mode
    description: Type of model to train (leave 'auto' if you're not sure).
    choices: [auto, face, object, style]
    default: auto
  max_train_steps:
    type: integer
    label: Training steps
    description: |-
      Number of training steps. Only increase this if you have lots of images (>50) otherwise the model wil overfit and will not look good.
    default: 3000
    minimum: 1000
    maximum: 5000
    step: 50
  lora_rank:
    type: integer
    label: Rank
    description: |-
      LoRA rank. Higher gives the model more capacity to learn but might lead to overfitting. 8 is almost always perfect.
    default: 8
    minimum: 2
    maximum: 32
    step: 1
  learning_rate:
    type: float
    label: Learning rate
    description: |-
      Learning rate for training. Higher values converge faster but too high might cause overfitting. Low values are more accurate but take more training steps.
    default: 0.5e-04
    minimum: 0.1e-04
    maximum: 2.0e-04
    step: 1.0e-05
  caption_prefix:
    type: string
    label: Custom Trigger Text
    description: Custom text to visually describe and trigger your model (leave this empty unless you know what you're doing!)
    required: false
  seed:
    type: integer
    label: Seed
    description: Set random seed for reproducibility. If blank, will be set to a random value.
    tip: |-
      You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!
    default: random
    minimum: 0
