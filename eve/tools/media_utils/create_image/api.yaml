name: Create Image
description: Generate or edit images.
tip: |-
  This tool generates and edits images.

  Rules:
  - Use 16:9, 1:1, and 9:16 aspect ratios for landscape, square, and portrait images respectively. Only use the other ones if specifically requested of you. If no aspect ratio is specified, use your best judgment depending on the content requested.
  - If the user wants to make an infographic, logo, or any other image that requires a lot of coherent and legible text, or the user requests OpenAI image tools, you should enable text_precision.
  - If either text_precision is enabled or there is an init_image, *and* there is no lora, the prompt should be structured as an **INSTRUCTION**.
  - If the user has an init_image but also has a lora or controlnet, ignore the last rule about being an instruction and instead make a normal text-to-image prompt.

  prompt:
    type: string
    label: Prompt
    description: Text prompt.
    tip: |-
      If generating an image from scratch, the prompt should be a visually detailed description of the image you want to generate. 
      
      May contain a primary subject and its action, including context like artistic medium, background, secondary items, color schemes, style or genre, mood, lighting, perspective, textures, time period, and cultural elements. 

      If the user gives vague or incomplete instructions, you may enhance their prompt to make it rich and detailed, but *always* strive to be as faithful to the user's intent as possible.
      
      If text_precision is enabled or there is an init_image (unless controlnet or lora), this should be structured as an **INSTRUCTION**. Instructions can and should be long and extremely detailed when necessary or requested. Make sure to refer to objects by what they are rather than using names or references to other things in the conversation, e.g. "Turn the woman's head into a green pumpkin" NOT "Turn Jane's head into the thing from the last image".

  aspect_ratio:
    type: string
    label: Aspect ratio

    default: "auto"
    choices: ["auto", "21:9", "16:9", "3:2", "4:3", "5:4", "1:1", "4:5", "3:4", "2:3", "9:16", "9:21"]
  init_image:
    type: image
    label: Input image
    description: Input image.
    tip: |-
      Only use this if you are editing an image, generating an image based on a reference image, or using ControlNet.
  # todo: add init_image_strength / prompt_strength
  controlnet:
    type: boolean
    label: Enable ControlNet
    description: Use shape guidance from init_image.
    tip: |-
      You should almost never use this. Use this **only** if the user ASKS FOR controlnet. This will conform the image to the shape of the init_image. Useful for style transfer / preserving the contours of the init_image. Generic image editing tasks should not use this.
    default: false
  lora:
    type: lora
    label: LoRA model
    description: ID of LoRA finetuned model.
    tip: This is optional if you want to capture a specific style, face, or object. This does nothing if you are editing an image.
  lora_strength:
    type: float
    label: LoRA strength
    description: Strength of the LoRA model
    tip: |-
      Higher values increase adherence/resemblance to the LoRA. Lower values may increase prompt adherence. Only works if you are using a LoRA. If the output does not look like the LoRA subject, can be increased (0.8-1.0). If the output does look like the subject but is ignoring the prompt too much, try decreating it (0.25-0.7).

  text_precision:
    type: boolean
    label: Enable precision
    description: Increase text and infographic precision.
    tip: |-
      If you are generating or editing an image and want to maximize the quality and legibility of text and small details, enable this. Uses OpenAI in the backend; If the user requests OpenAI's image tools, you should enable this. This is excellent for infographics, logos, and any other images that require a high degree of coherence, detail, and legibility, especially with text. IMPORTANT: This is **not** compatible with LoRA! If you need to combine this with a LoRA, it is better to first generate the base or reference image with the LoRA, then edit it with text_precision.
    default: false
  seed:
    type: integer
    label: Seed
    description: Set random seed for reproducibility. If blank, will be set to a random value.
    tip: |-
      You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!
