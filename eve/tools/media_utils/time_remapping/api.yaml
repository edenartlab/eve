name: Time Remapping
description: Adjusts the timing of videos by interpolating between frames
tip: Useful for slow motion, speed-up effects, or smoothing animations. Specify either target FPS, total frames, or duration.
output_type: video
parameters:
  video:
    type: string
    description: URL of the video to be time-remapped
    required: true
  target_fps:
    type: integer
    label: Target FPS
    description: Desired frames per second for output video
    tip: Leave empty to keep original FPS. Can be combined with total_frames or duration.
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 120
    default: 24
  total_frames:
    type: integer
    label: Total Frames
    description: Total number of frames in output video
    tip: Overrides duration if both are specified. Leave empty to calculate from FPS and duration.
    minimum: 1
  duration:
    type: float
    label: Duration
    description: Desired duration of output video in seconds
    tip: Leave empty to keep original duration. Ignored if total_frames is specified.
    minimum: 0.1
  blend_strength:
    type: float
    label: Blend Strength
    description: How much to blend between frames
    tip: 0 = nearest frame, 1 = full interpolation
    minimum: 0.0
    maximum: 1.0
    default: 1.0
  method:
    type: string
    label: Interpolation Method
    description: Method used for frame interpolation
    choices: [linear, cosine, nearest]
    choices_labels: [Linear, Cosine, Nearest]
    default: linear
    tip: Linear is simple, cosine is smooth, nearest repeats frames and has no blending
  loop_seamless:
    type: boolean
    label: Seamless Loop
    description: Preserve seamless looping sequences
    tip: When enabled, interpolates between last and first frame
    default: false
  preserve_pitch:
    type: boolean
    label: Preserve Audio Pitch
    description: Keep original audio pitch when changing duration
    tip: When true, maintains pitch but may affect quality on extreme stretching. When false, pitch changes with duration.
    default: true
  use_rife:
    type: boolean
    label: Use RIFE Interpolation
    description: Use RIFE AI model for high-quality frame interpolation
    tip: Higher quality for stretching frames, but slower than traditional methods. Requires additional dependencies.
    default: true
