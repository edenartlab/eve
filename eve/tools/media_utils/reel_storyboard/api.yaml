name: Reel Storyboard Artist
description: Create keyframe images with timing for video production. Produces storyboard from audio, transcript, and optional composition plan.
tip: |-
  Storyboard artist for reel pipeline. Creates keyframe images synced to audio timing.
  Uses composition_plan for awareness of musical sections (intros, drops, buildups).
  Output: ordered keyframes with timestamps (5-8s intervals each) and image URLs.
  Strategy: Generate 3 seed images first for consistency, then use as references for remaining keyframes.
  Returns `storyboard_transcript` in result: JSON array of {start, end, image_url, description} for each keyframe.
