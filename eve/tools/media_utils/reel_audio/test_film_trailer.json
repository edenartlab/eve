    "script": "A dramatic film trailer for a sci-fi thriller.\n\nStructure:\n- 0-8s: Quiet, tense intro (instrumental only)\n- 8-20s: Building tension with ominous music (instrumental only)\n- 20-25s: Musical climax/drop\n- 25-30s: Final dramatic line spoken over the aftermath\n\nThe only spoken line comes at the end:\nNARRATOR: \"They thought they were gods... until the sky fell.\"\n\nUse a composition_plan to structure the music precisely, with the dramatic drop at 20s. Generate the narrator line separately, pad it to start at 25s, then mix over the instrumental track.",
