    "script": "A dramatic film trailer for a sci-fi thriller.\n\nStructure:\n- 0-8s: Quiet, tense intro\n- 8-20s: Building tension with ominous music\n- 20-25s: Musical climax/drop\n- 25-30s: Final dramatic line spoken over the aftermath\n\nThe only spoken line comes at the end:\nNARRATOR: \"They thought they were gods... until the sky fell.\"\n\nWorkflow:\n1. Generate the narrator line with elevenlabs_speech\n2. Use elevenlabs_music with a composition_plan (include positive_global_styles, negative_global_styles, and sections with all required fields: section_name, positive_local_styles, negative_local_styles, duration_ms, lines as empty arrays for instrumental)\n3. Use audio_pad to delay the narrator line to start at ~25s\n4. Use audio_mix to layer the narrator over the instrumental",
