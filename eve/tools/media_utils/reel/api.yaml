name: Reel Composer
description: Compose a 30–300s reel from a simple brief. Optionally generate narration/music, create keyframes, turn them into clips, then assemble and mix into a single video.
tip: |-
  This tool runs without prior chat context. Always provide a self-contained <Task> with exactly three sections: Context, Instructions, Assets.
  Defaults if not stated: 60s runtime, ~5s shots, 1–2 refs/shot, hard cuts, mp4/h264/aac @1080p, −14 LUFS. If narration+music, make VO first; then instrumental music slightly longer and duck under VO.
  Return only the final video file.
