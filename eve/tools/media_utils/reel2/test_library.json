    "script": "A surreal, dreamlike short film set in an infinite library.\n\nUse the two attached images as character references - they are disembodied ceramic heads who float through this fantastical space.\n\nStructure:\n- 0-8s: Establishing shot of an impossibly vast library with endless towering bookshelves, staircases that lead nowhere, floating books. One ceramic head drifts into frame.\n- 8-16s: The second ceramic head appears from behind a shelf. They regard each other knowingly. Books orbit around them gently.\n- 16-24s: The two heads float together through grand halls, past spiral staircases and archways. Pages flutter around them like butterflies.\n- 24-32s: They settle in a cozy alcove, each with an open book floating before them, reading together in peaceful silence.\n\nThis is a music-only piece with no dialogue - let the visuals and music tell the story.",
