name: ffmpeg multi-tool
description: A generic tool that can combine / edit / convert image, video and audio files using ffmpeg. The output of this tool is always a single video!
tip: |-
  This tool executes a single linux terminal (typically ffmpeg) command that runs on (some of) the provided media inputs. 
  The input can contain 0-100 images, 0-30 videos and 0-30 audio files.
  For complex tasks it is recommended to consider chaining multiple, sequential calls to the ffmpeg multi-tool to avoid overly complex operations with a single ffmpeg call as this often leads to errors.
  Consider if the task can be easily achieved with a single ffmpeg command or if it requires multiple steps.
