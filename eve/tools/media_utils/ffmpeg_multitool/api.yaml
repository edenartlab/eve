name: ffmpeg multi-tool
description: A generic tool that can combine / edit / convert image, video and audio files using ffmpeg. The output of this tool is always a single video!
tip: |-
  This tool executes a single linux terminal (typically ffmpeg) command that runs on (some of) the provided media inputs. 
  For complex tasks it is recommended to consider chaining multiple, sequential calls to the ffmpeg multi-tool to avoid overly complex operations with a single ffmpeg call as this often leads to errors.
  Consider if the task can be easily achieved with a single ffmpeg command or if it requires multiple steps.
