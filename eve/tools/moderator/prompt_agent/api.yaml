name: Prompt Agent
description: |
  Prompt a specific agent to take their turn in the conversation.
  This is a SYNCHRONOUS operation - it waits for the agent to complete their turn
  before returning.

  The agent will see your hint (if provided) and any recent messages in their workspace.
  They will then generate a response and post it to the chatroom via the chat tool.

  Use this to give each agent their turn to speak. You can provide optional hints
  with factual state updates (e.g., "Round 3 of 5", "Budget: $500 remaining").
