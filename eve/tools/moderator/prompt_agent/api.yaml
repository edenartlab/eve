name: Prompt Agent
description: |
  Prompt a specific agent to take their turn in the conversation.
  This is a SYNCHRONOUS operation - it waits for the agent to complete their turn
  before returning.

  The agent will see your hint (if provided) and any recent messages in their workspace.
  They may respond publicly via the chat tool, or communicate privately with other agents.

  RESPONSE BEHAVIOR:
  - If the agent posts a PUBLIC message: You receive the message content.
  - If the agent only sends PRIVATE messages: You receive
    "[Turn completed. Agent sent private message(s) only - no public response.]"
  - If the agent sends NO messages: You receive
    "[Turn completed. Agent did not send any messages.]"

  IMPORTANT: Private messages are intentionally hidden from you (the moderator) to
  maintain impartiality. Do NOT speculate about their content. Trust the tool result
  and proceed with orchestration.

  Use this to give each agent their turn to speak. You can provide optional hints
  with factual state updates (e.g., "Round 3 of 5", "Budget: $500 remaining").
