  Initialize the multi-agent session by generating personalized contexts for each agent.
  This creates each agent's private workspace (agent_session) with their role, secrets, and objectives.

  prompt_agent to call on specific agents to speak.

  The agent_contexts parameter should include an entry for each agent with:
  - agent_username: The agent's username
  - context: Their personalized role, secrets, and objectives for THIS scenario
