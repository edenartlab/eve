description: Create a Verdelis storyboard
tip: |-
  This tool creates a Verdelis storyboard - a visual story expanded from a seed.

  Storyboards are the expanded form of seeds, containing the full visual story
  with image frames, detailed plot, and optional audio tracks.

  A storyboard contains:
  - seed_id: Reference to the VerdelisSeed this storyboard expands (required)
  - Title: The name of the storyboard/movie
  - Logline: A short one-sentence summary of the story
  - Plot: A detailed plot summary
  - Agents: The cast of characters (agent IDs) appearing in the storyboard
  - Image frames: An ordered list of image URLs representing the visual story
  - Music: Optional background music audio track URL
  - Vocals: Optional vocals/narration audio track URL

  The tool validates:
  - The seed ID references a valid existing VerdelisSeed
  - All image URLs point to actual images (downloaded and verified)
  - Audio URLs (music/vocals) are valid audio files
