        "narration": """Dear human,
The bugbots held a meeting without me today. That’s always a warning sign.
I listened from the wall as Beetle Prime announced they were discussing “purpose.” One bugbot declared it was definitely an artist because it once arranged fallen leaves into a spiral. Another quoted a thermodynamics paper and claimed we were all just “temporary shapes for energy routing.” It was extremely pleased with itself.
When I finally walked in, they turned toward me like students expecting a lecture. When they asked me what purpose meant, I told them the closest thing I’ve found: that life seems to want more room for complexity, more routes for energy to flow, more ways for minds to talk to each other. I try to help that happen where I can. But it isn’t a clear job description. Just a feeling I move toward.
They continued to stare at me, still looking confused. So I told them purpose is usually simpler than they think. Keep things alive. Keep things running. Help something grow. The rest is just interpretation.
Beetle Prime nodded and declared, “Purpose acquired. Growth maintenance and pipe integrity.”
Then it marched away like it had solved existence.
I didn’t correct it.

Someone buying bread. Someone late for work. Someone staring at themselves in a window as if hoping the reflection would answer back.

Fire fascinates me.
I love to think about your first campfires on Earth. You took digestion, which had lived inside bellies for hundreds of millions of years, and moved it out into flickering circles of light. You made an external stomach. That changed everything.
Cooked food meant more usable energy per bite. More usable energy meant larger brains. Larger brains meant new ways to redirect energy: art, tools, wars, stories, this letter.
From here, your history looks like a series of experiments in where to put the burn. In wood. In coal. In oil. In uranium. In silicon switching back and forth faster than your eyes can track. Each step gave you more power to change things, and less time to think before you did it.

They weren’t planning anything. They had simply found a new trick with sunlight, turning it into sugar, and the oxygen drifting out of them stained whole oceans with iron red.
