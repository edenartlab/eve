description: Create a Verdelis seed
tip: |-
  This tool creates a Verdelis seed - a snapshot of an idea.

  A seed is a simple container representing an initial creative concept that will
  later be expanded into a full Storyboard. Seeds capture the essence of an idea
  with a title, logline, and representative images.

  A seed contains:
  - Title: The name of the idea
  - Logline: A short one-sentence summary of the concept
  - Agents: The characters/agents involved in the idea
  - Images: Exemplary images that represent and summarize the idea

  The tool validates that all image URLs point to actual images (downloaded and verified).
