  "title": "Chiba",
  "proposal": "A living building stands alone in open desert. Chiba—part architecture, part organism—grows its own walls from engineered mycelium, harvests water from fog, breathes through porous surfaces that open and close with temperature. Inside: chambers that reconfigure based on inhabitants' needs, bioluminescent corridors, floors that heal cracks by growing new material.\n\nDocument Chiba as field study: exterior shots showing organic architecture against harsh landscape, interior spaces that feel grown rather than built, maintenance rituals (feeding nutrient substrate, pruning overgrowth, diagnosing stress through color changes), the relationship between Chiba and its small community of caretakers who live symbiotically with the structure. Is Chiba a building or a being? A shelter or a partner?\n\nShow desert wind moving through living walls, night bioluminescence, morning dew collection, seasonal adaptations. Chiba as proof that architecture can be life.A test proposal for a creation",
