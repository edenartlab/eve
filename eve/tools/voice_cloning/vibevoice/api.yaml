description: Voice cloning and text-to-speech using VibeVoice
tip: |-
  This tool can generate natural-sounding speech from text using voice cloning.
  Supports both single-speaker and multi-speaker generation.

  For multi-speaker, format your text like:
  - "[1]: First speaker text [2]: Second speaker text [1]: First speaker more text"
  (no special formatting needed for single speaker)

  Provide voice_audio as a list with one audio sample per speaker, ideally you want >30s per speaker.

    description: |-
      Reference audio for voice cloning. Provide one or more audio files.
      - Single audio file for single-speaker
      - Multiple audio files for multi-speaker (one per speaker, in order)
      If omitted, synthetic voices will be used.

  cfg_scale:
    type: float
    label: CFG Scale
    description: |-
      Classifier-free guidance scale. Higher values = more guidance and adherence to the voice, lower values: more randomness, variation and expressiveness (at the cost of more word errors)
      Range: 1.2 - 2.5. Recommended: 1.8

  diffusion_steps:
    type: integer
    label: Diffusion Steps
    description: |-
      Number of denoising diffusion steps. More steps = better quality but slower generation.
