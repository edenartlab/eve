tip: |-
  This tool creates a realistic animation from a single image. This is your primary/default tool for making videos or animations. It is the fastest image-to-video tool available. Only use other video tools if specifically asked to or asked to make abstract or VJing material.

      The prompt can be used to guide the animation in a certain direction.
    enhancement_prompt: |-
      1) Be visually descriptive, not conversational or command-based.

      Conversation or instructions may negatively impact results.

      Bad: can you please make me a video about two friends eating a birthday cake?
      Good: two friends eat birthday cake.

      Bad: add a dog to the image
      Good: a dog playfully runs across the field from out of frame

      2) Use visual details, not abstract or conceptual

      Bad: a man hacking into the mainframe.
      Good: a man vigorously typing on the keyboard.

      3) Use positive phrasing

      Negative phrasing (e.g. "don't include a dog") may have the opposite of the intended effect.

      Bad: no clouds in the sky. no subject motion.
      Good: clear blue sky. subtle and minimal subject motion.

      4) Apply to one visual item at a time

      Do not include multiple scenes or a series of shots in a single prompt. The prompt should apply to one a single scene.

      5) Include camera motion, action / dynamics, and aesthetic

      Some keywords that might describe camera styles: low angle, high angle, overhead, FPV, hand-held, wide angle, close-up, macro cinematography, over the shoulder, tracking, establishing wide, 50mm lens, SnorriCam, realistic documentary, camcorder.

      Lighting styles: Diffused lighting, silhouette, lens flare, back lit, Venetian lighting.

      Movement speeds: dynamic motion, slow motion, fast motion, timelapse

      Movement types: grows, emerges, explodes, ascends, undulates, warps, transforms, ripples, shatters, unfolds, vortex.

      Style and aesthetic: Moody, cinematic, iridescent, home video VHS, glitchcore.

      Text style: Bold, graffiti, neon, varsity, embroidery.
                                      
      Technical film terms can be helpful, including lighting terms, camera specifications, lens types/effects, etc. For example:sharp focus, photorealistic, RAW footage, 16mm, color graded Portra 400 film, ultra realistic, cinematic film, subsurface scattering, ray tracing, volumetric lighting.

      6) Very important: When given an input image alongside the text, have the prompt simply describe the movement or dynamics you want in the video. You *do not* need to describe the contents of the image. You should omit a description of the content of the image, since this is redundant.

      For example, if your image features a character, you might say "Woman cheerfully poses, her hands forming a peace sign."

      When you wave a prompt image, you should mostly focus on camera motion and subject dynamics (i.e. the action or movement of the subject).
                                                                      
      7) Do not include hateful, unsafe, offensive, or NSFW references in the prompt. If the prompt is unsafe, you should try to rewrite it in a safer or more wholesome way.
