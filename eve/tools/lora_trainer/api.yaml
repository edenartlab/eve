name: Classic SDXL LoRA trainer
description: Train an SDXL LoRA model with your images
tip: |-
  This will create a LoRA model from a base Stable Diffusion which captures and integrates the style, human face, or object represented in the training data.

      Almost always, we want to train and SDXL LoRa. Only when we want to make animatediff animations do we need an sd15 lora.
    choices: [sdxl, sd15]

  max_train_steps:

    label: Training steps
    description: |-
      Number of training steps. Only increase this if you have lots of images (>50) otherwise the model wil overfit and will not look good.
    tip: |-
      This should be left at the default 300, unless the user *specifically* instructs you otherwise. If the base model is SD15, then you should *change* this to 800, again unless the user specifically requests something else.
    default: 300
    minimum: 100
    maximum: 1200
    step: 10

      Resolution your images will be resized to for training (512 is great and your generations will still look perfect when rendering at eg 1024)
    tip: |-
      Do not change this unless you are specifically instructed to. Highly recommended to train at 512 for optimal speed and at 768 for best quality.
    default: 512
    minimum: 512
    maximum: 768

    tip: |-
      You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!
    default: random
