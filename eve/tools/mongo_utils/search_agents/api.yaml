description: Search database for agents
tip: Use this tool to search for agents based on a query. The agent_id field is the unique ID for the agent. Do not return more than 10 results. Note, the agent_id field is only meant to be used as a technical parameter for some tools. When referring to the agent in casual talk, use its name not ID. Just use the ID for tool calls, unless you are specifically asked for the ID.
