tip: |-
  Generates context‑aware music track from a single text prompt plus target length. Put all creative guidance in `prompt`: genre/mood, instrumentation, vocal handling (e.gh. use “a cappella” for just vocals, “instrumental only” for no vocals, “a capella” to have only solo vocals), tempo as BPM (e.g., “128 BPM”), key if relevant (e.g., “in A minor”), singer count/roles (e.g., “two singers harmonizing in C”), vocal tone (e.g., “breathy,” “aggressive”), structural timing cues (e.g., “lyrics begin at 15 seconds,” “instrumental only after 1:45”), language, and any ad/voiceover script or inline lyrics (preface with “Lyrics:” if provided). Aim for 1–3 tight sentences plus any timing/lyrics lines. You may include full lyrics in the prompt. If making backing or soundtrack music, make sure to include `instrumental only` to prevent vocals.
