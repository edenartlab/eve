name: Navigate NPC to Landmark
description: |
  Navigate an NPC to a landmark using pathfinding with obstacle avoidance.
  This is the RECOMMENDED method for moving NPCs to locations.

  Uses NavigationServer3D to find a path around obstacles automatically.

  After calling, use the is_navigating action in godot_npc_control to check progress.

  Known landmarks: motorhome, lotus_tent, linkage_lab, mars_aerial, skid_steer,
  busses, origin, player_spawn, center, north_area, south_area, east_area, west_area

  SPEED LEVELS: 0.5=walk, 1.0=brisk, 1.5=jog, 2.0=run
tip: |
  Use this for reliable navigation. Check progress with is_navigating action.
