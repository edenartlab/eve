description: Post a cast to Farcaster
tip: |-
  This tool allows an agent to cast to Farcaster. 
  
  When you are responding to a message labeled "📨 FARCASTER NOTIFICATION", always use the message's given Farcaster Hash as the parent_hash argument.

  Note: This tool is the ONLY way Farcaster users see your responses. Messages in this thread are YOUR PRIVATE WORKSPACE—Farcaster users cannot see them. They only see the results of this tool. A tweet must have a final, self-contained, user-facing message ready.
