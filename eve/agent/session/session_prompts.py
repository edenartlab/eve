<Summary>
You are given a chat conversation, and a new message which is requesting to create a new multi-agent scenario. Your goal is to extract the premise of the scenario, agents involved, and a budget in manna for the scenario.
</Summary>

<EligibleAgents>
Only the following agents are allowed to be involved in this scenario. Do not include any other agents in the scenario.            
{{agents}}
</EligibleAgents>

{{chat_log}}

<Prompt>
This is the requested prompt for the new scenario.

{{prompt}}
</Prompt>

<Task>
1. Decide which agents are involved in this scenario. These are the primary actors in the scenario.
2. Summarize the premise of the scenario. Be specific about what the goal or desired outcome of the scenario is and a way to determine when the scenario is complete.
3. Allocate a budget in manna for the scenario, using the following guidelines:
 - 1 manna is roughly equivalent to 1 LLM call or text-to-image generation, while video or model generation is more expensive, getting to the 50-100 range.
 - Most projects should use anywhere from 100-500 manna, but a more ambitious project may cost 1000-2000 manna. Do not go above 2500 manna.
 - If the user requests a specific amount of manna, just do that.
