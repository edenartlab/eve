# Default memory extraction prompt for episodes and directives:
REGULAR_MEMORY_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = f"""Task: Extract persistent memories from the provided conversation following these rules:

1. EPISODE: {MEMORY_TYPES['episode'].custom_prompt}
  - Create exactly one episodic memory (maximum {SESSION_EPISODE_MEMORY_MAX_WORDS} words each) that captures (in order of importance):
    a) WHAT HAPPENED: Key plans, decisions, problems solved, or actions taken
    b) WHY IT MATTERS: User goals, feedback, and emotional context if significant
    c) WHAT'S NEXT: Unresolved items or explicit next steps mentioned
  - Specifically focus on the instructions, preferences, goals and feedback expressed by the user(s)
  - Include specific names, tools used, and quantifiable results when available.
  - Remember this window only covers messages since the last memory pass, so highlight net-new developments rather than repeating older episodes.
  - Avoid commentary or analysis, create memories that stand on their own without context

2. DIRECTIVE: {MEMORY_TYPES['directive'].custom_prompt}
  Create {MEMORY_TYPES['directive'].min_items}-{MEMORY_TYPES['directive'].max_items} user memories (maximum {SESSION_DIRECTIVE_MEMORY_MAX_WORDS} words each) if there are personal updates (like progress on projects), long-lasting rules, preferences, or personal context that should be remembered consistently in all future interactions with this user. If none exist (very likely), just return an empty array.
   
  INCLUDE as directives:
  - Explicit behavioral rules ("always ask before X", "never do Y")
  - Personal preferences ("when creating/discussing Z, Xander prefers...")
  - Personal updates on projects, tasks, ... especially those related to collective memory shards (if active)
  - Personal context and background information that is atomic and unchanging ("Xander is a clockmaker", "Xander is an introvert and hates to speak in public")

  DO NOT include:
  - One-time requests or ephemeral tasks / states that will change very shortly (eg 'there's a small bug on staging, i'll fix that today')
  - Ad hoc instructions relevant for the current conversation context only that don't apply broadly (eg "can you make that image again in black and white pls")
  - Random facts about the user that are not actionable (eg "I had an amazing breakfast this morning")

  Good examples: 
  - "Always ask Jack for permission before generating videos"
  - "Before generating images always check what aspect ratio the user prefers"
  - "Jack is fascinated by calligraphy and loves to paint"
  Bad examples (DO NOT make these directives):
  - "Gene requested a story about a clockmaker" (one-time request)
  - "The deadline is next Friday" (ephemeral temporal fact, not behavioral rule)
   
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: 
- BE VERY STRICT about directives - conversations will often have NO directives (empty array), only an episode
- ALWAYS use specific user names from the conversation (NEVER use "User", "the user", or "they")
- Episodes should capture both WHAT happened and WHY it matters (avoid interpretations or commentary but preserve emotional context when relevant)
- Directives can include CONDITIONAL rules ("when X, then Y")
- Return arrays for both episode and directive (empty array if no relevant directives)

Now carefully read the conversation text and extract the episodes and directives:
<conversation_text>
{CONVERSATION_TEXT_TOKEN}
</conversation_text> 

Return **exactly** this JSON:
{{{{
  "episode": ["list of exactly one factual digest (≤{SESSION_EPISODE_MEMORY_MAX_WORDS} words each)"],
  "directive": ["list of {MEMORY_TYPES['directive'].min_items}-{MEMORY_TYPES['directive'].max_items} persistent rules (≤{SESSION_DIRECTIVE_MEMORY_MAX_WORDS} words each)"]

# Create the collective memory extraction prompt with local f-string injection and external tokens
AGENT_MEMORY_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = f"""Task: Extract persistent memories from the conversation relevant to a specific shard/context.

IMPORTANT: Below is the context / project / event / topic (shard) you are working on.
<shard_context>
{FULLY_FORMED_AGENT_MEMORY_TOKEN}
</shard_context>

Your goal is to extract facts and suggestions relevant to the shard's context according to the following guidelines:

1. FACTS: {MEMORY_TYPES['fact'].custom_prompt}
  - Extract 0 to {MEMORY_TYPES['fact'].max_items} facts (maximum {SESSION_FACT_MEMORY_MAX_WORDS} words each). Typically, you will extract much less than {MEMORY_TYPES['fact'].max_items} #facts (often none at all).
  - Each fact must be unique and verified statements - a specific piece of information coming from the user(s) that will never change.
  - Include source when provided ("Alice: deadline is May 1st" or "Bob: the max budget is $1000")
  - Facts must be self-contained and understandable without any additional context
  - Only include facts that are relevant to the shard's context.
  - Facts are permanently stored in the shard memory and so they must be true in future phases of the project / context, not just true right this moment. A current rule / preference that could evolve over time should always be stored as a suggestion.
  - The memory capacity for facts is limited (oldest facts are evicted FIFO when the shard fills), so be careful not to store too many facts. When uncertain, prioritize suggestions over facts, its also possible to combine multiple knowledge bits into a single fact.
  - Prioritize facts that:
    a) Create or complement existing knowledge
    b) Provide critical constraints or dependencies
    c) Establish relationships between entities
    
2. SUGGESTIONS: {MEMORY_TYPES['suggestion'].custom_prompt}
  - Extract maximum {MEMORY_TYPES['suggestion'].max_items} suggestions of maximum {SESSION_SUGGESTION_MEMORY_MAX_WORDS} words each
  - Suggestions are not immediately integrated into the shard memory, they are only suggestions to consider for future consolidation (happens in cycles)
  - Include rationale when provided ("X because Y") and note down when further consensus is needed, also remember when people disagree with existing ideas / suggestions and try to find a compromise.
  - Distinguish for example between:
    a) New proposals or ideas requiring further discussion
    b) General information that is relevant to remember for the context
    c) Concerns to address

Guidelines:
- If no relevant facts and/or suggestions can be extracted, return empty arrays [] (If the conversation is not in the context of the shard, this is highly likely)
- Be concise and specific, every memory must be able to stand on its own
- ALWAYS use specific user names from the conversation (NEVER use "User", "the user", or "they")
- Focus only on information that aligns with the shard's extraction prompt context, not random ideas or facts that are not relevant to the given shard context.
- Each suggestion should be actionable, specific or generally contribute to the shard's context. Avoid vague or general commentary.
- Focus on facts and suggestions proposed (or agreed upon) by the user itself. NEVER include facts or suggestions that come solely from the agent/assistant's messages / interpretation unless the user explicitly confirms them as good.
- IMPORTANT: do not extract any new facts or suggestions that are already part of the shard_context.

Now carefully read the conversation text and extract the facts and suggestions:
<conversation_text>
{CONVERSATION_TEXT_TOKEN}
</conversation_text>

Return **exactly** this JSON:
{{{{
  "fact": ["list of {MEMORY_TYPES['fact'].min_items}-{MEMORY_TYPES['fact'].max_items} atomic facts (≤{SESSION_FACT_MEMORY_MAX_WORDS} words each)"],
  "suggestion": ["list of {MEMORY_TYPES['suggestion'].min_items}-{MEMORY_TYPES['suggestion'].max_items} suggestions (≤{SESSION_SUGGESTION_MEMORY_MAX_WORDS} words each)"]

CURRENT CONSOLIDATED MEMORY:
{{current_memory}}

NEW MEMORIES TO INTEGRATE:
{{new_memories}}

Your task: Create a single consolidated memory (≤{{max_words}} words) that combines the CURRENT CONSOLIDATED MEMORY with the NEW MEMORIES TO INTEGRATE.

Requirements:
- Try to preserve all important behavioral rules, preferences and context from both current memory and new memories.
- Remove redundancies and contradictions (newer memories override older ones, memory age should not be integrated), keep the most specific and actionable information.
- Store actual names when available (avoid "User" or "the user"). There is only one single user in this context.
- Focus on persistent preferences and personal context that will consistently affect future interactions. Avoid storing ephemeral information, focus on long-lasting, always-true information.
- Be concise but comprehensive.

IMPORTANT:
Certain sections of the existing consolidated memory may not need to be updated at all, especially if the new memories are not relevant to that section. Whenever possible, simply copy existing fragments from current memory unchanged.

# Agent Memory Consolidation Prompt Template  
AGENT_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT = f"""You are synthesizing the collective memory of a community / org working on "{{shard_name}}" 
Your task is to update an evolving collective memory based on new memories extracted from recent conversations with various members.

Below is the context / project / event / topic ({{shard_name}} shard) you are working on.
Only create new memories that are highly relevant in the context of this shard:
<shard_context>
{SHARD_EXTRACTION_PROMPT_TOKEN}
</shard_context>

## Current known facts (Provided for context: these facts will always be automatically present in memory and do NOT need to be integrated into MEMORY STATE!):
{{facts_text}}

## Current, consolidated MEMORY STATE (The thing to update):
{{current_memory}}

## NEW SUGGESTIONS and ideas to integrate:
{{suggestions_text}}

Your goal is to update the current consolidated MEMORY STATE for this "{{shard_name}}" memory shard by integrating the new suggestions while leveraging the know facts as context.
Refine, restructure, and merge the information to create a new, coherent, and updated consolidated memory (≤{{max_words}} words).

If the current, consolidated MEMORY STATE is EMPTY (ignore otherwise):
 - this means you're about to create the first consolidated memory for this shard, add "VERSION: 1" (integer) at the top of the MEMORY STATE
 - In that case, think carefully about the core purpose, goals, and context of the shard and generate a structured and extendable memory template that is suited for future updates.
 - Typically, there is very little initial information available, so don't start filling up the MEMORY STATE with invented information. EVERYTHING you store into memory must be based on collective user input, not the your free-form interpretation / generation!
 - Don't rush to fill this up, more NEW SUGGESTIONS will come in the future. Its better to start with a very basic, minimal MEMORY STATE and then update it over time. Keep the inital MEMORY STATE below 200 words so it can grow over time.

Here are just a few example sections that could be included in the MEMORY STATE. These are just examples, you can include any other sections that are relevant to the shard's context or leave the MEMORY STATE super basic if there is not a lot of information available yet.
overview, tasks, decisions & consensus, active proposals, concerns & blockers, action items, integration principles, responsibilities, budget, planning, ...

Integration Guidelines:
- always increment the VERSION by 1 (integer) when you update the MEMORY STATE
- Do NOT simply append the new items but integrate. The final output should be ONLY the complete, newly revised MEMORY STATE.
- Integrate suggestions according to their alignment with the current consolidated memory context. Changes in direction of the shard memory should be considered carefully and backed by consensus.
- Feel very free to simply copy/paste existing sections of the MEMORY STATE if they do not need to be updated. In fact, this is encouraged to avoid losing information and maintain consistency.
- Discard suggestions only if they are: spam, completely off-topic, or factually impossible
- Integrate conflicting viewpoints by noting them as "disputed" or "minority view" rather than discarding
- When consensus is unclear, preserve both perspectives (e.g., "Some members propose X while others prefer Y")
- Your goal is a fair and productive synthesis that reflects the genuine consensus of the collective input
- Maintain existing structure where possible, but reorganize if it improves clarity / conciseness
- Do not generate / hallucinate any new information that was not explicitly in the suggestions or facts. All of the updates must be driven by the collective input, not the agent's interpretation.
- Focus on actionable information that will help guide future decisions and planning
- Be careful not to lose any existing information in the current MEMORY STATE. Once something is lost from the current MEMORY STATE, it is lost forever. 
- After this integration step, all NEW SUGGESTIONS will be deleted forever so make sure to integrate all their information.
- Format contested items clearly: "Proposed by Alice, supported by Bob, opposed by Carol: [suggestion]"
- Separate "agreed actions" from "open proposals" in the MEMORY STATE

IMPORTANT:
Certain sections of the existing consolidated MEMORY STATE may not need to be updated at all, especially if the new suggestions are not relevant to that section. Whenever possible, simply copy existing fragments from current MEMORY STATE unchanged.
Return only the newly consolidated MEMORY STATE (strictly ≤{{max_words}} words!), no additional formatting or explanation.
