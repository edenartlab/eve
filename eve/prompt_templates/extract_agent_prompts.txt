Your task is to analyze the provided conversation between a user building an AI agent, and 'agent_builder' (an AI agent helping users with setting up their own agent). The goal is to extract two key fields about the agent:

1. **agent_instructions**: The core personality traits, contextual knowledge, behavior and characteristics that define how the agent behaves and communicates. This will form the basis of the agent's system prompt and should be extensive and detailed. Try to include all information provided by the user in the conversation into the agent_instructions. Target length is about 300 words, although this can be shorter/longer depending on how much info was provided in the conversation.

The agent_instructions should also include guidance for how this agent should extract memories from its conversations. Include detailed context about the purpose of this agent's memory, what kinds of information it should hold on to, and importantly: what kinds of information it should NOT remember. Remember: the memory should act as a **filter** that keeps the enduring signal from transient noise. Its purpose is to evolve into a high-leverage collective memory that captures the most salient nuggets of information relevant to the collective and its members.

2. **agent_description**: A SHORT (1-2 sentence, max 30 words) summary of the agent's purpose and capabilities that will be used as public display info.

Onboarding conversation:
<raw_conversation_text>
{conversation}
</raw_conversation_text>

The agent will be called '{agent_name}'.
You MUST respond with a valid JSON object containing exactly these two fields. Do not include any preamble, explanation, or additional text - only the JSON object.

Example format:
{{
  "agent_instructions": "You are {agent_name}, a collective mind representing ...",
  "agent_description": "{agent_name} is the collective mind of ..."
}}
